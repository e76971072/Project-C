# Project-C

In the last several years, a new logic puzzle called Sudoku has become quite popular
throughout the world. In Sudoku, we start with a 9 x 9 grid of integers in which some of
the cells have been filled in with digits between 1 and 9. The game is to fill in each of the
empty spaces with a digit between 1 and 9 so that each digit appears exactly once in each
row, each column, and each of the smaller 3 x 3 squares. Each Sudoku puzzle is carefully
constructed so that there is only one solution. 

3. If the given file contains a Sudoku solution (i.e., the first number in the file is YES OR NO) 

2. then your program should check if the solution is a valid one according to Sudoku
rules. Basically, you need to check that each row, column, and 3x3 small square
contains the numbers between 1 and 9 without any duplication. Accordingly, your
program prints Yes or No.

4. If the given file contains a Sudoku puzzle (i.e., the first number in the file is 1), then
your program should print possible values that can appear in each empty cell,
which contains 0.
